//o	Include a brief explanation of how you approached the problem, focusing on how each concept was used in your solution.
//EXPLANATION:
//The objectives is ato create a system where you can manage books and a library, 
//and that it had to make sure the data (like the price of a book) is kept safe. 
//Additionally we can add, remove, and list books easily. 
//I followed the sequence intructions one by one in order for me not to be confused and have messy codes.

//Key concepts like access modifiers were used to control visibility of properties, 
//ensuring that only certain parts of the code can change or access them. 
//Constructors were used to automatically set up objects when theyâ€™re created, 
//while setters and getters managed the updating and retrieval of data safely. 
//The __call() magic method is used to handle calls to non-existent methods, simulating method overloading. 
//Lastly, the destructor is implemented to clean up resources when the library is no longer needed.

//A summery of the program flow is:
//1. Book objects are created.
//2. Library object is created.
//3. Books are added to the library.
//4. Stock is updated using the magic method.
//5. Books are listed.
//6. A book is removed.
//7. Books are listed again.
//8. Library is destroyed, triggering the destructor.
